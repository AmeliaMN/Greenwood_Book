<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Histograms, boxplots, and density curves</h2>
<p>Part of learning statistics is learning to correctly use the terminology, some of which is used colloquially differently than it is used in formal statistical settings. The most commonly “misused” statistical term is <strong><em>data</em></strong>. In statistical parlance, we want to note the plurality of data. Specifically, <strong><em>datum</em></strong> is a single measurement, possibly on multiple random variables, and so it is appropriate to say that “<strong>a datum is…</strong>”. Once we move to discussing data, we are now referring to more than one observation, again on one, or possibly more than one, random variable, and so we need to use “<strong>data are…</strong>” when talking about our observations. We want to distinguish our use of the term “data” from its more colloquial<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> usage that often involves treating it as singular. In a statistical setting “data” refers to measurements of our cases or units. When we summarize the results of a study (say providing the mean and SD), that information is not “data”. We used our data to generate that information. Sometimes we also use the term “data set” to refer to all our observations and this is a singular term to refer to the group of observations and this makes it really easy to make mistakes on the usage of “data”<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It is also really important to note that <strong><em>variables</em></strong> have to vary – if you measure the sex of your subjects but are only measuring females, then you do not have a “variable”. You may not know if you have real variability in a “variable” until you explore the results you obtained.</p>
<p>The last, but probably most important, aspect of data is the context of the measurement. The “who, what, when, and where” of the collection of the observations is critical to the sort of conclusions we can make based on the results. The information on the study design provides information required to assess the scope of inference of the study. Generally, remember to think about the research questions the researchers were trying to answer and whether their study actually would answer those questions. There are no formulas to help us sort some of these things out, just critical thinking about the context of the measurements.</p>
<p>To make this concrete, consider the data collected from a study <span class="citation">(Plaster <a href="#ref-Plaster1989">1989</a>)</span> to investigate whether perceived physical attractiveness had an impact on the sentences or perceived seriousness of a crime that male jurors might give to female defendants. The researchers showed the participants in the study (men who volunteered from a prison) pictures of one of three young women. Each picture had previously been decided to be either beautiful, average, or unattractive by the researchers. Each “juror” was randomly assigned to one of three levels of this factor (which is a categorical <em>predictor</em> or <em>explanatory</em> variable) and then each participant rated their picture on a variety of traits such as how warm or sincere the woman appeared. Finally, they were told the women had committed a crime (also randomly assigned to either be told she committed a burglary or a swindle) and were asked to rate the seriousness of the crime and provide a suggested length of sentence. We will bypass some aspects of their research and just focus on differences in the sentence suggested among the three pictures. To get a sense of these data, let’s consider the first and last parts of the data set:</p>

<p>When working with data, we should always start with summarizing the sample size. We will use <strong><em>n</em></strong> for the number of subjects in the sample and denote the population size (if available) with <strong><em>N</em></strong>. Here, the sample size is <strong><em>n=114</em></strong>. In this situation, we do not have a random sample from a population (these were volunteers from the population of prisoners at the particular prison) so we cannot make inferences from our sample to a larger group. But we can assess whether there is a <strong><em>causal effect</em></strong><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>: if sufficient evidence is found to conclude that there is some difference in the responses across the treated groups, we can attribute those differences to the treatments applied, since the groups should be same otherwise due to the pictures being randomly assigned to the “jurors”. The story of the data set – that it was collected on prisoners – becomes pretty important in thinking about the ramifications of any results. Are male prisoners different from the population of college males or all residents of a state such as Montana? If so, then we should not assume that the detected differences, if detected, would also exist in some other group of male subjects. The lack of a random sample makes it impossible to assume that this set of prisoners might be like other prisoners. So there are definite limitations to the inferences in the following results. But it is still interesting to see if the pictures caused a difference in the suggested mean sentences, even though the inferences are limited to this group of prisoners. If this had been an observational study (suppose that the prisoners could select one of the three pictures), then we would have to avoid any of the “causal” language that we can consider here because the pictures were not randomly assigned to the subjects. Without random assignment, the explanatory variable of picture choice could be <strong><em>confounded</em></strong> with another characteristic of prisoners that was related to which picture they selected and the rating they provided. Confounding is not the only reason to avoid causal statements with non-random assignment but the inability to separate the effect of other variables (measured or unmeasured) from the differences we are observing means that our inferences in these situations need to be carefully stated to avoid implying causal effects.</p>
<p>Instead of loading this data set into R using the “Import Dataset” functionality, we can load an R package that contains the data, making for easy access to this data set. The package called <code>heplots</code> <span class="citation">(Fox and Friendly <a href="#ref-R-heplots">2017</a>)</span> contains a data set called <code>MockJury</code> that contains the results of the study. We also rely on the R package called <code>mosaic</code> <span class="citation">(Pruim, Kaplan, and Horton <a href="#ref-R-mosaic">2017</a>)</span> that was introduced previously. First (but only once), you need to install both packages, which can be done either using the Packages tab in the lower right panel of RStudio or using the <code>install.packages</code> function with quotes around the package name:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="op">&gt;</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">&quot;heplots&quot;</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>After making sure that both packages are installed, we use the <code>require</code> function around the package name (no quotes now!) to load the package, something that you need to do any time you want to use features of a package.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">require</span>(heplots)
<span class="kw">require</span>(mosaic)</code></pre></div>
<p>When you are loading a package, R might mention a need to install other packages. If the output says that it needs a package that is unavailable, then follow the same process noted above to install that package and then repeat trying to load the package you wanted. These are called package “dependencies” and are due to one package developer relying on functions that already exist in another package.</p>
<p>To load the data set that is available in an active package, we use the <code>data</code> function.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">data</span>(MockJury)</code></pre></div>
<p>Some data sets, like this one, will load in a different data set framework called a “data frame” (its class in R is “data.frame”). You can leave it in this format but for consistency of output, we will change it to a <em>tibble</em> using the <code>as.tibble</code> function in the code that follows. Now there will be a tibble called <code>MockJury</code> available for us to analyze and some information about it in the <strong>Environment</strong> tab. Again, we can find out more about the data set in a couple of ways. First, we can use the <code>View</code> function to provide a spreadsheet type of display in the upper left panel. Second, we can use the <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> functions to print out the beginning and end of the data set.</p>

<p>If we take a few moments to explore the output we can discover some useful aspects of the data set. The output is organized by variable, providing summary information based on the type of variable, either counts by category for categorical variables (<code>Attr</code> and <code>Crime</code>) or the 5-number summary plus the mean for quantitative variables. If present, you would also get a count of missing values that are called “NAs” in R. For the first variable, called <code>Attr</code> in the data.frame and that we might more explicitly name <em>Attractiveness</em>, we find counts of the number of subjects shown each picture: <span class="math inline">\(37\)</span> out of <span class="math inline">\(114\)</span> viewed the “Unattractive” picture, <span class="math inline">\(38\)</span> viewed “Average”, and <span class="math inline">\(39\)</span> viewed “Beautiful”. We can also see that suggested prison sentences (variable <code>Years</code>) ranged from 1 year to 15 years with a median of 3 years. It seems that all the other variables except for <em>Crime</em> (type of crime that they were told the pictured woman committed) contained responses between 1 and 9 based on rating scales from 1 = low to 9 = high.</p>
<p>To accompany the numerical summaries, histograms and boxplots can provide some initial information on the shape of the distribution of the responses for the suggested sentences in <em>Years</em>. Figure <a href="2-1-section2-1.html#fig:Figure2-1">2.1</a> contains the histogram and boxplot of <em>Years</em>, ignoring any information on which picture the “jurors” were shown. The calls to the two plotting functions are enhanced slightly to add better labels.</p>

<p>The distribution appears to have a strong right skew with three observations at 15 years flagged as potential outliers. You can only tell that there are three observations and that they are at 15 by looking at both plots – the bar around 15 years in the histogram has a count of three and the boxplot only shows a single point at 15 which is actually three tied points at exactly 15 years plotted on top of each other (we call this “overplotting”). These three observations really seem to be the upper edge of the overall pattern of a strongly right skewed distribution, so even though they are flagged in the boxplot, they really are not outside the pattern we observed so are not outliers. In real data sets, outliers are commonly encountered and the first step is to verify that they were not errors in recording (if so, fixing or removing them is easily justified). If they cannot be easily dismissed or fixed, the next step is to study their impact on the statistical analyses performed, potentially considering reporting results with and without the influential observation(s) in the results. If the analysis is unaffected by the “unusual” observations, then it matters little whether they are dropped or not. If they do affect the results, then reporting both versions of results allows the reader to judge the impacts for themselves. It is important to remember that sometimes the outliers are the most interesting part of the data set.</p>
<p>Often when statisticians think of distributions of data, we think of the smooth underlying shape that led to the data set that is being displayed in the histogram. Instead of binning up observations and making bars in the histogram, we can estimate what is called a <strong><em>density curve</em></strong> as a smooth curve that represents the observed distribution of the responses. Density curves can sometimes help us see features of the data sets more clearly.</p>
<p>To understand the density curve, it is useful to initially see the histogram and density curve together. The height of the density curve is scaled so that the total area under the curve<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> is 1. To make a comparable histogram, the y-axis needs to be scaled so that the histogram is also on the “density” scale which makes the bar heights adjust so that the proportion of the total data set in each bar is represented by the area in each bar (remember that area is height times width). So the height depends on the width of the bars and the total area across all the bars has to be 1. In the <code>hist</code> function, the <code>freq=F</code> option does this required re-scaling to get density-scaled histogram bars. The density curve is added to the histogram using the R code of <code>lines(density())</code>, producing the result in Figure <a href="2-1-section2-1.html#fig:Figure2-2">2.2</a> with added modifications of options for <code>lwd</code> (line width) and <code>col</code> (color) to make the plot more interesting. You can see how the density curve somewhat matches the histogram bars but deals with the bumps up and down and edges a little differently. We can pick out the strong right skew using either display and will rarely make both together.</p>

<p>Histograms can be sensitive to the choice of the number of bars and even the cut-offs used to define the bins for a given number of bars. Small changes in the definition of cut-offs for the bins can have noticeable impacts on the shapes observed but this does not impact density curves. We are not going to tinker with the default choices for bars in histogram as they are reasonably selected, but we can add information on the original observations being included in each bar to better understand the choices that <code>hist</code> is making. In the previous display, we can add what is called a <strong><em>rug</em></strong> to the plot, where a tick mark is made on the x-axis for each observation. Because the responses were provided as whole years (1, 2, 3, …, 15), we need to use a graphical technique called <strong><em>jittering</em></strong> to add a little noise<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> to each observation so all the observations at each year value do not plot as a single line. In Figure <a href="2-1-section2-1.html#fig:Figure2-3">2.3</a>, the added tick marks on the x-axis show the approximate locations of the original observations. We can see how there are 3 observations at 15 (all were 15 and the noise added makes it possible to see them all). The limitations of the histogram arise around the 10 year sentence area where there are many responses at 10 years and just one at both 9 and 11 years, but the histogram bars sort of miss this aspect of the data set. The density curve did show a small bump at 10 years. Density curves are, however, not perfect and this one shows area for sentences less than 0 years which is not possible here.</p>

<p>The graphical tools we’ve just discussed are going to help us move to comparing the distribution of responses across more than one group. We will have two displays that will help us make these comparisons. The simplest is the <strong><em>side-by-side boxplot</em></strong>, where a boxplot is displayed for each group of interest using the same y-axis scaling. In R, we can use its <strong><em>formula</em></strong> notation to see if the response (<code>Years</code>) differs based on the group (<code>Attr</code>) by using something like <code>Y~X</code> or, here, <code>Years~Attr</code>. We also need to tell R where to find the variables – use the last option in the command, <code>data=DATASETNAME</code> , to inform R of the tibble to look in to find the variables. In this example, <code>data=MockJury</code>. We will use the formula and <code>data=...</code> options in almost every function we use from here forward. Figure <a href="2-1-section2-1.html#fig:Figure2-4">2.4</a> contains the side-by-side boxplots showing right skew for all the groups, slightly higher median and more variability for the <em>Unattractive</em> group along with some potential outliers indicated in two of the three groups.</p>

<p>The “~” (which is read as the <em>tilde</em> symbol, which you can find in the upper left corner of your keyboard) notation will be used in two ways this semester. The formula use in R employed previously declares that the response variable here is <em>Years</em> and the explanatory variable is <em>Attr</em>. The other use for “~” is as shorthand for “is distributed as” and is used in the context of <span class="math inline">\(Y\sim N(0,1)\)</span>, which translates (in statistics) to defining the random variable <em>Y</em> as following a Normal distribution<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> with mean 0 and standard deviation of 1. In the current situation, we could ask whether the <code>Years</code> variable seems like it may follow a normal distribution, in other words, is <span class="math inline">\(\text{Years}\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)\)</span>? Since the responses are right skewed with some groups having outliers, it is not reasonable to assume that the <em>Years</em> variable for any of the three groups may follow a Normal distribution (more later on the issues this creates!). Remember that <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> are parameters where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> (“mu”) is our standard symbol for the <strong><em>population mean</em></strong> and that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> (“sigma”) is the symbol of the <strong><em>population standard deviation</em></strong>.</p>
